ABSTRACT = {A vision-based autonomous system for emasculating okra enhances agriculture by enabling precise flower bud identification, overcoming the labor-intensive, error-prone challenges of traditional manual methods with improved accuracy and efficiency. This study presents a framework for an adaptive, automated bud identification method to assist the emasculation process, hybridized optical coherence tomography (OCT). Three YOLOv8 variants were evaluated for accuracy, detection speed, and frame rate to identify the most efficient model. To strengthen the findings, YOLO was hybridized with OCT, enabling non-invasive sub-surface verification and precise quantification of the emasculated depth of both sepal and petal layers of the flower bud. To establish a solid benchmark, gold standard color histograms and a digital imaging-based method under optimal lighting conditions with confidence scoring were also employed. The results demonstrated that the proposed method significantly outperformed these conventional frameworks, providing superior accuracy and layer differentiation during emasculation. Hence, the developed YOLOv8 hybridized OCT method for flower bud identification and emasculation offers a powerful tool to significantly improve both the precision and efficiency of crop breeding practices. This framework sets the stage for implementing scalable, artificial intelligence (AI)-driven strategies that can modernize and optimize traditional crop breeding workflows.},

abstract = {The MV X-Press Pearl (XPP) maritime disaster on May 25, 2021, released approximately 75 billion microplastic (MP) nurdles into the Indian Ocean and degraded due to the elevated temperatures, a cocktail of chemicals, physical abrasions, and environmental factors. While degradation-induced surface-level chemical and morphological changes were well documented, internal degradation remains largely unexplored. This study highlights the utilization of high-resolution optical coherence tomography (OCT) as a purely non-destructive imaging modality to discover profound internal alterations in the micrometer range, such as internal hollow regions, cracks, and voids in MP nurdles subjected to different degrees of degradation. The dark pixel intensity probability density corresponds to the degraded areas, increased from 0.0019 (pristine nurdle) to 0.0135–0.5252 for thermal degradation, 0.0878–0.3134 for chemical degradation, and 0.1291–0.2179 for mechanical degradation, indicating progressive internal degradation. Attenuated total reflectance fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy analysis confirmed that all the nurdles are polyethylene (PE) and revealed that extreme conditions lead to the formation of new functional groups, including hydroxyl bands and carbonyl bands, even though PE is highly resistant to degradation. The integration of high-resolution OCT imaging with FTIR analysis provides novel insights into the interconnection between micrometer-scale internal physical alterations and associated chemical modifications of MP nurdles resulting from environmental degradation. These findings highlight the potential of this OCT-FTIR integrated approach for advancing the understanding of MP degradation and its long-term environmental impacts.}

ABSTRACT = {Clinical fetal monitoring devices can only be operated by medical professionals and are overly costly, prone to detrimental false positives, and emit radiation. Thus, highly accurate, easily accessible, simplified, and cost-effective fetal monitoring devices have gained an enormous interest in obstetrics. In this study, a cost-effective and user-friendly wearable home fetal movement and distress detection device is developed and assessed for early-stage design progression by facilitating continuous, comfortable, and non-invasive monitoring of the fetus during the final trimester. The functionality of the developed prototype is mainly based on a microcontroller, a single accelerometer, and a specialized fetal phonocardiography (fPCG) acquisition board with a low-cost microphone. The developed system is capable of identifying fetal movement and monitors fetal heart rhythm owing to its considerable sensitivity. Further, the device includes a Global System for Mobile Communication (GSM)-based alert system for instant distress notifications to the mother, proxy, and emergency services. By incorporating digital signal processing, the system achieves zero false negatives in detecting fetal movements, which was validated against an open-source database. The acquired results clearly substantiated the efficacy of the fPCG acquisition board and alarm system, ensuring the prompt identification of fetal distress.},

ABSTRACT = {Circular leaf spot (CLS) disease poses a significant threat to persimmon cultivation, leading to substantial harvest reductions. Existing visual and destructive inspection methods suffer from subjectivity, limited accuracy, and considerable time consumption. This study presents an automated pre-identification method of the disease through a deep learning (DL) based pipeline integrated with optical coherence tomography (OCT), thereby addressing the highlighted issues with the existing methods. The investigation yielded promising outcomes by employing transfer learning with pre-trained DL models, specifically DenseNet-121 and VGG-16. The DenseNet-121 model excels in differentiating among three stages of CLS disease (healthy (H), apparently healthy (or healthy-infected (HI)), and infected (I)). The model achieved precision values of 0.7823 for class-H, 0.9005 for class-HI, and 0.7027 for class-I, supported by recall values of 0.8953 for class-HI and 0.8387 for class-I. Moreover, the performance of CLS detection was enhanced by a supplemental quality inspection model utilizing VGG-16, which attained an accuracy of 98.99% in discriminating between low-detail and high-detail images. Moreover, this study employed a combination of LAMP and A-scan for the dataset labeling process, significantly enhancing the accuracy of the models. Overall, this study underscores the potential of DL techniques integrated with OCT to enhance disease identification processes in agricultural settings, particularly in persimmon cultivation, by offering efficient and objective pre-identification of CLS and enabling early intervention and management strategies.},

ABSTRACT = {Speckle patterns are a generic feature in coherent imaging techniques like optical coherence tomography (OCT). Although speckles are granular like noise texture, which degrades the image, they carry information that can be benefited by processing and thereby furnishing crucial information of sample structures, which can serve to provide significant important structural details of samples in in vivo longitudinal pre-clinical monitoring and assessments. Since the motions of tissue molecules are indicated through speckle patterns, speckle variance OCT (SV-OCT) can be well-utilized for quantitative assessments of speckle variance (SV) in biological tissues. SV-OCT has been acknowledged as a promising method for mapping microvasculature in transverse-directional blood vessels with high resolution in micrometers in both the transverse and depth directions. The fundamental scope of this article reviews the state-of-the-art and clinical benefits of SV-OCT to assess biological tissues for pre-clinical applications. In particular, focus on precise quantifications of in vivo vascular response, therapy assessments, and real-time temporal vascular effects of SV-OCT are primarily emphasized. Finally, SV-OCT-incorporating pre-clinical techniques with high potential are presented for future biomedical applications.},

abstract = {The monetary value of grid electricity is inflating significantly due to the staggeringly broadening gap between electricity demand and supply, which arise from the unceasing growth of consumption demands. Although heuristic optimization based demand side management has its merits, incorporating Ant Colony Optimization remains disputable due to its tendency to converge at a local optimum. Therefore, this work presents a hybridized algorithm of Ant Colony Optimization and Genetic Algorithm, which alleviates the drawbacks of Ant Colony Optimization through Genetic Algorithm. The proposed work promotes sustainable energy utilization simultaneously with demand-side optimization. The performance of the proposed algorithm is compared with no scheduling instance, Ant Colony Optimization based energy management controller, and mutated Ant Colony Optimization based appliance scheduling. The proposed algorithm successfully curtails 35.4% from community peak load demand and achieves 33.67% cumulative cost saving for the community. In other words, comparative analysis confirms the supremacy of the proposed algorithm in terms of minimizing peak load, total cost, peak-to-average ratio, and waiting time, while providing prevailing insights about proposed algorithm as a sustainable solution approach.}

ABSTRACT = {The rapid evolution towards industrial automation has widened the usage of industrial applications, such as robot arm manipulation and bin picking. The performance of these applications relies on object detection and pose estimation through visual data. In fact, the clarity of those data significantly influences the accuracy of object detection and pose estimation. However, a majority of visual data corresponding to metal or glossy surfaces tend to have specular reflections that reduce the accuracy. Hence, this work aims to improve the performance of industrial bin-picking tasks by reducing the effects of specular reflections. This work proposes a deep learning (DL)-based neural network model named SpecToPoseNet to improve object detection and pose estimation accuracy by intelligently removing specular reflections. The proposed work implements a synthetic data generator to train and test the SpecToPoseNet. The conceptual breakthrough of this work is its ability to remove specular reflections from scenarios with multiple objects. With the use of the proposed method, we could reduce the fail rate of object detection to 7\%, which is much less compared to specular images (27\%), U-Net (20\%), and the basic SpecToPoseNet model (11\%). Thus, it is claimable that the performance improvements gained are positive influences of the proposed DL-based contexts such as bin-picking.},

ABSTRACT = {The identification of defects in apple leaf specimens is crucial for mitigating crop loss and maintaining harvest quality. This study investigates the applicability of an intensity detection simulation-integrated optical cross-sectional modeling method for detecting defective apple leaf specimens. The technique utilizes a customized 840 nm optical coherence tomography (OCT). The method involved using a peak-intensity detection technique to analyze OCT signal intensity variations in multi-layered leaf structures. Results demonstrate the potential of the method to identify morphological differences between leaf specimens from healthy and infected trees and, specifically, healthy leaf specimens from infected trees. Implementing this method enables cost saving through timely interventions to reduce the impact of leaf defects on crop production.},

abstract  ={The existing ocular pH detection methods encounter numerous limitations{,} including low accuracy{,} poor sensitivity across a wide pH range{,} and patient discomfort{,} highlighting the need for innovative approaches. A novel biosensor for ocular pH detection has been developed to assess ocular health and chemical injuries in clinical settings. This study uses the pH-sensitive properties of anthocyanins (ATH){,} natural pigments extracted from butterfly pea flowers{,} to develop a novel pH-responsive nanofiber mat. ATH is integrated into a polymer blend containing polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP){,} ethyl cellulose (EC){,} and (2-Hydroxypropyl)-β-cyclodextrin (BCD) to fabricate electrospun nanofibers. The acquired characterizations{,} employing scanning electron microscopy (SEM){,} Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR){,} X-ray diffraction (XRD){,} and Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) confirmed the successful fabrication of the ATH-infused nanofibers with a mean diameter ranging from 121 to 396 nm. Four formulations were tested: PVP:EC:BCD:ATH (18 ppm){,} PVP:EC:BCD:ATH (25 ppm){,} PVP:EC:BCD:ATH (35 ppm){,} and PVP:EC:BCD:ATH (50 ppm). Among them{,} the 50 ppm ATH-incorporated nanofiber mat exhibited the best performance in terms of color clarity{,} response time{,} and pH sensitivity. The fabricated 50 ppm ATH incorporated nanofiber mat demonstrated a rapid pH response time of less than 5 seconds (sec) while exhibiting a color variation from pink to blue to green across the pH range of 1 to 12{,} providing a rapid and accurate method for visual pH detection. Based on the color performance of the 50 ppm ATH-incorporated system{,} a standardized color reference chart was developed to serve as a practical and visual guide for estimating pH levels in clinical applications. Zebrafish toxicity assays were conducted further to validate the safety and biocompatibility of the developed sensor{,} revealing no significant toxic effects across the range of ATH concentrations.}
